vision christian radio.                                         
i need to establish communications with them in order too       
setup a telstra/bigpond retrievable relay at waix.               
so the monopoly telco does not punish me for listening to them. 
then setup a transmitter on sumerhaze so i can pick it up

on a normal fm radio away from summerhaze in the black holes.    
i also need an easy to read text guide of schedule.
