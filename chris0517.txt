hiya chris,

unfortunately bonz would need a skippers license/registration or something like 

that as the hp on both versions are too much.

thank you though for your information,

hiya Chris,

do torquedo have any intentions of doing a hull mounted motor that is a 24-7 

immersed but mounted on hull of the boat.

i'm just trying to extract info from bonz which is so hard sometimes!!

hi mandyleigh,

i haven’t ever sold minn kota motors.  they are often available at fishing boat 

sales centres and there is probably one in your area. 

check out whitworths

https://www.whitworths.com.au/main_searchresults.asp

they have outlets at leederville and mosman park.  is that nearby to you?

cheers
