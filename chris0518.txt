hi mandyleigh,

we need to differentiate between the hp and the kw that is used for licencing purposes.

for example here in queensland the maximum power for an unregistered craft is 3kw. 

So on my solar boat I use a 2kw outboard (same propulsion unit as the 2kw pod) and so that is ok.

if you convert that power to hp, the conversion is 745 watts equals 1 horsepower, 

so this motor is technically equal to 2.7 hp.  and this is the hp that you use when 

conforming to government regulations.

for practical use, because electric motors have a large amount of torque, 

and no losses from things such a water pump, we use a rule of thumb equivalent, 

such as the 2kw being similar to a 5 or 6 HP outboard in its performance, and if we used this equivalence it would not conform.  but that is not what they ask for.

cheers

chris
