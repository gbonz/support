goal is a portable comms/router type device on prepaid 3g data.

needs 3g sim microsd and no fan capable of running termux/linux terminal apps

need to be able to seperate the data running from os

and hence be able to backup entire device with data from microsd

and be able to overwrite just the os junk if a systemn failure occurs.

this needs to be doable on the device or by popping the sd into a new device.

needs to have a working date/time at a glance unlike on ip hone.

configurable notifications/messages thing all easilly readable unlike ip hone.

proper training in its usage to kill/start apps and using things like zoom

colour configuring without going insane with migrainne pain from white setup screens.

how to lock apps like browser when used as a shortcut for banking etc with my own pin.

a pin setable for different things unrelated to the os itself which should be usable.

an automagic bluetooth setup for using video/microphone without touching device.
