need an app to 

vibrate phone when it is one station before stating on screen

indicating left or right door in conjunction to the travel direction

maybe have the capacity of bluetooth for emergencies,

interupting bluetooth with notices and corrections

this app must not need a telco data connection to function.

the current transperth app sucks big time and is unusable due to this
