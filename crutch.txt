issues with my walking aid.

i need an aid i can hold with arthritic hand for undulating terrain.

current one i can hold for brief moments but sustained use is agony.

i presently use it with creek bank on my right side meaning it needs to be shorter for this use on friday.

but for walk back over same terrain the creek is lower on my right side hence it needs to be longer then crutch.

the current adjustment mechanism is beyond my ability to use at all.

maybe removable ergonomic handle with self centering pin that can be easily released would work.

transperth insist on having slippery/dangerous surces with tactil paving for sight impaired also.

nothing i can do about the tactile rubbish other then to avoid it completely and use bitumen where i can.

but i need a sock i can slip over foot for when it is raining on the slippery junk i have no choice to use.

the foot of the crutch has a tendency to bananarise itself due to terrain/abuse i endure from others.

everytime i am shuvved and my entire weight goes through the stick the foot is stressed.

all previous walking sticks have bent at this point about 3-6cm from stopper.
