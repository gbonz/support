A support person to will need to assist Bonz 9 hours
per week 52 weeks a year to get his personal affairs 
in order and tackle problems of daily living.
This includes but is not limited to: supporting Bonz 
to communicate / advocate with Government Departments, 
health services and businesses. To deal with mail; move 
through processes, fill out forms and ensure that steps 
are completed to achieve desired outcomes. Assist Bonz 
to communicate his needs and organise information to 
reduce frustration and confusion. Bonz will also need 
support to access the community, particularly when 
mobility limitations make accessing supports and 
services an unsafe proposition. Bonz has requested 
that he have at least 5 hours per week of this support
in the afternoon so he can maximize his free travel 
period with Transperth.
