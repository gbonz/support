after much experiment with 3way freezer i need a compressor freezer

must be ac and 12 maybe higher v dc compatible.

not exceed 500 mm in one dimension and be a chest type freezer with bag.

freezer must operate safely within bag at all times with remote thermometer.

bag must be salt/uv tolerant keeping both from freezer.

and prefarbly muffle compressor noise completely.

needs to freeze to below -20c
