this is simple info to contact bonz on irc.

i currently use the server called freenode

it has a domain of irc.freenode.net amongat others.

my dedicated support/memory bridge channel is #summerhaze

please only use this for pertinent stuff i need to know.

general chitchat/junk can happen on the other channels.

this can be on #perth #campfire or #cairns.

i also provide weechat support on #weechat but nothing else.

you may not /msg me at anytime as i use a query_blocker.

this is done in order to reduce my confusion/missing info.
