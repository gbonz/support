to make service readable without needing html, etc i propose.

title, etc starting from left margin.

starting all audible text spoken by lead 3 chars in from left edge.

then all congregation text a further 3 spaces in.

so for example

page 1

a boring title example

   minister speaks ...

      congregation responds...

end of service.

end of example 

i need the page/title stuff still to search with / and ? when you skip.

but at present the current haphazard indention confuses me as well.

the minister speaks would be replaced with what you say not need any label.

i need to get this format sorted so ml can help me implement it.

if you perceive any issues i need to include them here for clarity for ml.

i also need all the ? and caps removed and replaced with readable text.

other question to double space or not to doublespace?

i use less2 for viewing all text presently

but modifying the text myself is migraine making if it is single spaced.

line length should probably be limited to 65chars.

this file is set to a limit of 80 to allow readable font size on linux,

however this is not always possible on some os like ms.

goal is for all files to be readable on any os without special software.
