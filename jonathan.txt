existing issues with mint.

i tend to hibernate dell on lid closed/low power.

it is my desire to only hibernate on low power.

if i do a system upgrade on debian no issues.

if i do a system upgrade on mint it cripples hibernate/suspend.

given i do not get to choose when i run out of power

i do not want this insane default.

konsole has no beep/crashes in mint if i drag a term/launch urls.

used to function properly in debian.

roxterm does not beep and cannot change tab by default too .

vlc trashes desktop in vm till i change too a tty/back in vm.

usb mouse does not work in ms10/vm properly only right mouse button.

ultimately i need a working computer i can suspend/hibernate and switch apps in.

booting off sd, etc is prefered of course for portable data/os with ms as fallback.

otherwise ssd of whatever device needs to be split between host/shared data for vm.
