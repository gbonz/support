existing issues with mint.

i tend to hibernate dell on lid closed/low power.

it is my desire to only hibernate on low power.

if i do a system upgrade on debian no issues.

if i do a system upgrade on mint it cripples hibernate/suspend.

given i do not get to choose when i run out of power

i do not want this insane default.

konsole crashes in mint if i drag a term/launch urls.

functions properly in debian.

ultimately i need a working computer i can suspend/hibernate.

booting off sd, etc is prefered of course for portable data/os.
